Please create the following folders as git does not allow to have empty folders:

folder_1
folder_2
folder_process
folder_thread

And please copy the large files in folder_1.

"Assignment2.py" copies the files from folder_1 into folder_2.
"Assignment2_process" copies the files from folder_1 into folder_process (using processes).)
"Assignment2_thread" copies the files from folder_1 into folder_thread (using threads).
